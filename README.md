# Brainswarm - Design & Simulation Working Group ðŸš€
Welcome to the Design & Simulation Working Group of Brainswarm! This repository serves as a structured learning hub for interns to develop expertise in robot simulation, URDF modeling, and ROS 2 integration.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository
This repository contains:
âœ… Learning Roadmap â€“ A structured plan covering 3D modeling, URDF, ROS 2, and Gazebo.
âœ… Hands-on Tasks â€“ Weekly tasks and assignments for interns to practice skills.
âœ… Simulation Projects â€“ Real-world robotic simulations developed by the team.
âœ… Resources & Tutorials â€“ Guides, references, and useful links for learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Model robotic systems in SOLIDWORKS and export them to URDF.
Simulate robots in Gazebo and integrate with ROS 2.
Develop robotic environments for testing and experimentation.
Collaborate using GitHub to track progress and contribute to the teamâ€™s projects.
ðŸš€ Getting Started
