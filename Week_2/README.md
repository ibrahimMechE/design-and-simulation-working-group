### **Week 2 Tasks**

#### **Task 1: Advanced SOLIDWORKS Modeling

- **Objective:** Improve SOLIDWORKS proficiency by modeling and refining a **mobile robot chassis with mounting points for sensors and actuators**.
- **Description:** You are given the STEP file for Robot Chassis in **Supporting Materials** directory. Use that to model mounting point for RPLidar.
  - Download RPLidar Model from GrabCAD
  - Take proper dimensions of that Model and note them
  - Create a mounting point for that RPLidar on Robot Chassis according to noted dimensions.
- Micro-Project:
  - Design a **detailed chassis** with proper constraints, dimensions, and mounting holes.
  - Upload the model to GitHub for team collaboration.

#### **Task 2: Assembly of Robot Model

- **Objective:** Take the **chassis model from Task 1** and assemble it with wheels, sensors, and actuators, ensuring a complete robot model.
- Micro-Project:
  - **Import the chassis from Task 1** and add components (wheels, sensors, actuators).
  - Ensure all components have proper **constraints and clearances** in the assembly.
  - Push the **updated Assembly file** to GitHub.

------

#### **Task 3: Integrating the Robot into Simulation

- **Objective:** Use the URDF File in **Supporting Materials** Directory, named `simbot_description` .
- Micro-Project:
  - **Import the updated URDF model** into Unity/Gazebo.
  - Ensure proper **collision, physics, and material properties** are applied.
  - Test and validate the robot’s spawn position in the environment.
  - Push the final simulation setup to GitHub.

### **Synchronization Overview:**

- **Task 1 (Mechanical Design)** → Provides the **chassis design**.
- **Task 2 (Assembly & URDF)** → Creates a **complete model**.
- **Task 3 (Simulation)** → Tests the **final model** inside the simulation world.
