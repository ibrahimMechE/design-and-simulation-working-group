# 🏁 Challenge: Navigate Through a Maze (Block Coding)

## 🎯 Objective  
Your task is to **program a robot to navigate through a maze** using a block-based programming interface. This challenge will help you understand logical sequencing, and basic publisher / subscriber concept in ROS2.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Learn  
✅ Basics of block-based programming  
✅ Controlling a virtual robot  
✅ Understanding motion and navigation in a simulated environment  
✅ Debugging and improving navigation logic  

## 📌 Instructions  
1. **Set Up the Maze Environment**  
   - Open the block coding platform (**e.g., Scratch, Blockly, or any simulator used in this internship**).  
   - Load the pre-defined **maze world** (provided in the repository or create your own). 

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot3
   ```
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot3-gazebo ros-humble-turtlebot3-simulations
   ```
   
2. **Program the Robot**  
   - Use block-based programming to make the robot move forward, turn left, and turn right.  
   - Develop a sequence that allows the robot to navigate through the maze successfully.  
   - Implement **loops and conditional statements** to optimize the movement.  

3. **Test and Debug**  
   - Run your program and observe the robot's movement.  
   - Make necessary adjustments to improve the efficiency of the navigation.  
   - Try different maze layouts for additional practice.  

## 🎯 Bonus Challenges  
🔥 Can you modify your program to **solve the maze autonomously** using decision-making blocks?  
🔥 Can you use **sensors (if available)** to detect walls and avoid obstacles?  

## 🚀 How to Submit Your Solution  
1. **Record a short screen capture** of your robot navigating the maze successfully.  
2. **Upload your block-based program (.sb3, .xml, or equivalent file format).**  
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** with a short description of your approach and challenges faced.  

🏆 **Best solutions will be featured!** Have fun coding and exploring robotic navigation!
