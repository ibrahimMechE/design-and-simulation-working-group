## üìå **Instructions for Interns**  

1. **Download the Provided CAD Files**  
   - You will find **STEP files** of various robot components here.  
   - Currently available: **TurtleBot3 Burger STEP file**.

2. **Create Your Assembly**  
   - Import the **STEP file** into **SOLIDWORKS** (or your preferred CAD software).  
   - Assemble the components properly using constraints and mates.  
   - Make sure your assembly follows realistic mechanical design principles.  

3. **Submit Your Assembly**  
   - Once you have completed your assembly, save it as a **SOLIDWORKS assembly file (`.SLDASM`)**.  
   - Name your file using the format:  
     ```
     YourName_TurtleBot3_Assembly.SLDASM
     ```
   - Add any additional parts you created in the same directory.  

4. **Commit and Push Your Work to GitHub**  
   - Navigate to this directory in your local repository.  
   - Add your files using Git:  
     ```bash
     git add CAD_Files/YourName_TurtleBot3_Assembly.SLDASM
     git commit -m "Added TurtleBot3 assembly by YourName"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - If you are unsure how to do this, refer to the **Git Workflow Guide** in the repository.
